A boiler-plate file for my embedded system projects. Created by üêè @Peltogle üêè [(my website)](http://peltogle.com)

## What & Why?
This is a boiler-plate file that allows me to quickly establish preliminary two-way communication with most Arudino based boards. This boiler-plate assumes that two servos, a multi-color LED, a PSB, a BNO055 module, and a BMP280 module are connected to the microcontroller. More information and functionality will be added to this repo as I further test this project on other components and more boards.

## Known Issues
**Solved issues will be checked off**
- [ ] Library files and other important secondary files are missing.
- [ ] Depending on pin setup the BMP280 or BNO055 modules may not work correctly.
- [ ] Sea-level is hardcoded in and needs to be changed manually, will soon revert to my other APIs to fix this.
If you happen to actually use this boiler-plate and want to report issues or make feature requests, please use GitHub's built in bug tracker.
