A skeleton starter file for my embedded system projects.

## What & Why?
This is a skeleton file that allows me to quickly establish preliminary two-way communication with most Arudino based boards. This skeleton file assumes that two servos, a multi-color LED, a PSB, a BNO055 module, and a BMP280 module are connected to the microcontroller. More information and functionality will be added to this repo as I further test this project on other components and more boards.
