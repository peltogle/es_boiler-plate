# es_boilerplate
A boilerplate for my embedded system projects. Created by üêè @peltogle üêè [(my website)](http://peltogle.com)

## What & Why?
This is a boilerplate that allows one to quickly establish preliminary two-way communication with most Arduino based boards. This boilerplate assumes that two servos, a multi-color LED, a PSB, a BNO055 module, and a BMP280 module are connected to the microcontroller (more components later). More information and functionality will be added to this boilerplate as I further test this project on other components and more boards.

## Known Issues
**Solved issues will be checked off**
- [ ] Library files and other important secondary files are missing.
- [ ] Depending on pin setup the BMP280 or BNO055 modules may not work correctly.
- [ ] Some variables are hard-coded that should not be. I will be using one of my previous projects to fix this.

### Fixing Regressions & Requesting Features
If you happen to actually use this boilerplate and want to report issues or make feature requests, please use GitHub's built in bug tracker. Keep in mind that there is more to this boilerplate that has yet to be released due to the need for me to actually whip out a bunch of my Arduino based boards and testing this boilerplate on them.
